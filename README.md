# Sorting Visualizer

Java program to visualize sorting algorithms.
Run from `SortingVisualizerCLI`.

Currently, only Bubble Sort is implemented (option 1).
The other sorting algorithms are left for you to implement :)

An in depth explanation of `Bubble Sort` is given in the `demo/BasicSortingDemo.java` class

I recommend doing the following sorting algorithms first:
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort

Followed by these sorting algorithms which use recursion:
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort

A list of algorithms can be found here:
